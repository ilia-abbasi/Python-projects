open cmd/terminal and enter:

pip install translate

then use the script.
You can change the languages if you want, by editing the script.

FROM is the language you input.
TO is the language you want to get.

This script is written by github.com/ilia-abbasi using the "translate" module.
But you can use the script however you want, there is no need to copy this ReadMe file
or copy the name of the author, when using this script somewhere else.

Thanks!
